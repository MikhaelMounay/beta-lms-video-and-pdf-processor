# Beta LMS

> A secure LMS platform enabling online lectures with offline access, live sessions, protected PDF notes, and comprehensive assessments with strict content and account protection.

This is an _internal utility tool_ to process/encrypt video & PDF files before uploading them to host storage for use within the `Beta LMS` platform.

Based on the deprecated, and now archived, `beta-lms-pdf-processor` and `beta-lms-video-processor` repos.
