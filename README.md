# Beta LMS

> A secure LMS platform enabling online lectures with offline access, live sessions, protected PDF notes, and comprehensive assessments with strict content and account protection.

This is an _internal utility tool_ to process/encrypt video & PDF files before uploading them to host storage for use within the `Beta LMS` platform.

Based on the deprecated, and now archived, [beta-lms-video-processor](https://github.com/MikhaelMounay/beta-lms-video-processor) and [beta-lms-pdf-processor](https://github.com/MikhaelMounay/beta-lms-pdf-processor) repos.
